# ke
Keep decimal time with this set of utilities.

* ke.py – Use with GeekTool to put a little Ke counter (to one decimal place) on your Mac desktop.  
* TinyScreen_Ke – An app for the TinyDuino with TinyScreen: displays the time (to 2 decimal places) when any button is pushed.  
* Bean_Ke – Make a LightBlue Bean blink an LED and vibrate approximately once per ke. Wear it as a pendant, and establish an intuitive sense of decimal time. See the project: http://www.hackster.io/glowascii/hypnos-pendant
